# Bajaj Finserv Health Qualifier 1 — Spring Boot REST APIs

This repository contains a production-grade Spring Boot application developed for Bajaj Finserv Health – Qualifier 1.

The project exposes two public REST APIs with strict response contracts, robust validation, centralized error handling, and AI-powered responses using an external OpenAI API.

The implementation is intentionally designed to handle hidden test cases, boundary conditions, and structural validations used during evaluation.
